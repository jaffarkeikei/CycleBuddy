    style Research fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Dashboard fill:#bff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Integration Mechanisms

1. **AI Insights â†’ Education**
   - Health insights generated by the AI can recommend specific educational modules to address knowledge gaps
   - The AI contract includes references to relevant module IDs in its insights

2. **Education â†’ Research**
   - Completing educational modules increases user's reputation in the research marketplace
   - Higher education levels unlock more advanced research projects
   - The NFT contract notifies the research contract when users earn credentials

3. **Research â†’ AI Insights**
   - Contributing quality data improves the training of AI models
   - The research contract includes data quality metrics that feed into the AI models

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Privacy-Preserving Computation

**Challenge**: Performing machine learning analysis on health data while preserving user privacy.

**Solution**: Integration with Stellar Turrets to run secure computation on encrypted data without exposing raw user information.

### NFT Credential Management

**Challenge**: Creating verifiable educational credentials that are both private and transferable.

**Solution**: Custom NFT asset issuance through Stellar with metadata that can be selectively shared with healthcare providers.

### Decentralized Research Contributions

**Challenge**: Enabling anonymous data contributions while maintaining data quality and preventing fraud.

**Solution**: Reputation system with quality assessment algorithms that don't require personal identification.

## Deployment and Interaction

The features are deployed as Soroban smart contracts on the Stellar network and interact with the frontend through the contractService.ts interface.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Deployment Flow"
        Build[Build Contracts] --> Test[Test Contracts]
        Test --> Deploy[Deploy to Stellar]
        Deploy --> Initialize[Initialize Contracts]
        Initialize --> Monitor[Monitor & Upgrade]
    end
    
    subgraph "User Interaction Flow"
        Connect[Connect Wallet] --> Authenticate[Authenticate User]
        Authenticate --> Execute[Execute Contract Functions]
        Execute --> View[View Results]
    end
    
    Deploy --> Connect
```

This architecture ensures:
- Transparent contract execution
- User data sovereignty
- Privacy-by-design
- Interoperability with healthcare providers
- Scalable feature development
